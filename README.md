# 🎯 Linear Table Filter Demo

Hey there, awesome human! 👋 Welcome to the **Linear Table Filter Demo** - a super cool project that shows off a filtering system just like the one in Linear! 

## 🤔 What's This All About?

This project is a fun little demo that recreates Linear's powerful table filtering system. It's like having superpowers for your data tables! ✨ You can filter by:

- 📝 Customer Name (text)
- ✅ Resolution Status (resolved or unresolved)
- 🔢 Issue Numbers (numbers)
- 🚨 Priority Levels (dropdown options)
- 📅 Creation Dates (calendar picking)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with some really cool tech (but don't worry, we won't get too nerdy):

- ⚡ **Next.js** - Makes our app super fast and SEO-friendly
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** - For making things pretty without crying
- 🧩 **React** - Because components are life
- 🔍 **Filter Components** - Our own custom filtering magic

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (fancy way of saying "download it")
2. Run `npm install` (gets all the ingredients ready)
3. Run `npm run dev` (fires up the kitchen)
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (dinner is served!)

## 🎮 How To Use It

1. Go to the main page
2. See that fancy "Issues" section? Click on the filter button
3. Pick what you want to filter by (customer, status, etc.)
4. Choose your conditions and values
5. Hit "Apply" and watch the magic happen! ✨
